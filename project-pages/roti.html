    <p> always prepare kulcha recipes for my lunch or dinner with any paneer-based curries or with soya chunks curry. However, I was surprised to learn that in Punjab these naan bread recipes are eaten for breakfast as a street food. Especially aloo kulcha recipe with plain raita or mint raita is the most popular breakfast meal in the sub-continent. The interesting part of this kulcha is the potato stuffing. The stuffing is made with a range of spices thus making a perfect bread to be served with mint raita or yogurt dip. In addition, the bread is made in a traditional tandoor oven making it a unique stuffed bread. Do try this simple kulcha on tawa and I am certain that it would be appreciated.</p>
