    <h3>About Recipe</h3>
    <p>If you’re in India and you come across ‘vada’ or ‘bada,’ you must know that this is a category of savory snacks, which are usually fried. Largely, some different variations of these vadas can be classified as cutlets, fritters, dumplings or donuts.</p>
     <p>A typical vada can be made using lentils or legumes, vegetables, sago or a combination of all, along with veggies, seasonings, spices and herbs that are added to enhance the taste, texture and nutritive value. Some vada versions include Dahi Vada, Sabudana Vada, Maddur Vada and more.</p>
<p>All these various vada have different recipes and methods of preparation. Mostly in many variations, the lentils are soaked and then ground to make a batter. In some variations like in Batata Vada recipe the batter is made from dry gram flour rather than whole lentils with a spiced savory potato stuffing encased inside.</p>
